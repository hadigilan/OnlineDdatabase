# OnlineDdatabase

This repository tries to introduce economics and financial databases, either publicly available databases or private ones. This attempt had already started
with [dataDr](http://datadr.blogfa.com/) weblog for Iranian students in Farsi, which dates back to February 2011. From June 2023, we decided to expand the applicability of this project through GitHub in English.



# The google sheet
This [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10I5rRRPchQpULvUGnYzoN5AEEdtjNdejYqe_P0F4-C0/edit?usp=sharing) introduces online databases. It contains different columns as pillar of each database including:
1. a link to the database
2. short description
3. application(s)
4. country
5. availability of data
6. a "How to use it!" column to explain how to use the database

It also has a specific sheet to introduce macro events in the history of US which are used as exogenous shocks in literature. It is periodically updated.
